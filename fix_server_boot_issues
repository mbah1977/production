Hard Drive:
lsscsi or lsblk   #    list SCSI devices (or hosts) and their attributes , this is useful when kernel error logs report isues with a device
[root@puppetmaster production]# lsscsi

smartctl -H /dev/sda  # to test the health of a device. # This command is used to run a self-test on the device to see if it has failed. It can also be used to check detailed information about a device
smartd is the daemon that monitors hard drives. When you run #systemctl status smartd #you will see currently attached scsi devices under the monitor of smartd
#Hard drives will show issues too when it cannot be found, it position has changed, meaning the system is not seeing it
#also when it has been converted to RO, by the kernel. Meaning there is an issue with writing to it.
#if the drive is corrupt only , then fsck or xfs_repair on it can fix it. 


Network:
ifdown ens33 # turn up interface
ifup ens33   # turn down interface
ifconfig -s  # short list of interfaces
ifconfig  -a # list all interfaces
interface stats:
RX errors, dropped, overruns(buffer full) # if any of the values if non-zero, then the nic has issues
TX errors, dropped, overruns, carriers, collisions # if there is a non-zero value, then there is an issue with the nic.
