git remote add production git@github.com:mbah1977/production.git #After cloning a github repo, and creating a new branch locally, you use this command to add the branch to the git repo

git push -u <origin> production  #After you commit your stuff to the new branch, you use this command to push to the remote repo . origin branch is the name of the main branch that contains the previous commits.

if you remove the origin branch with git remote remove <branch-name> then alawys use git push <branch> to push to remote atfter.
#The name of the repo is the name you will find on the local system after cloning a repo, not the name of the branch that you create.

git remote -v # this will tell you how many branches you have on the remote repo

git remote remove <branch name> # this will remove the remote branch from the repo

Make sure you inside a repo before you do anything that has been be saved in the repo. In this case you must cd into the production dir here git@github.com:mbah1977/production.git, which is the name of the remote repo you will find as a directory on the cmdline.

git commit --allow-empty -m "initial empty commit". You cannot change or create branches in Git until you have committed at least one change.
Rename the 'master' branch to 'production' with git branch -m master production
Push your changes with git push origin production

    Create a new branch by running git branch <NAME-OF-NEW-BRANCH>
    Check out the new branch by running git checkout <NAME-OF-NEW-BRANCH>
    Edit the Puppetfile as needed for your new environment, and save your changes.
    Commit your changes by running git commit -m "a commit message summarizing your change"
    Push your changes by running git push origin <NAME-OF-NEW-BRANCH>
    Deploy your environments as you normally would.

    If you have set up a Code Manager webhook or script trigger, it deploys the environments automatically when you push your changes. Alternatively, deploy the environments on the command line with Code Manager or r10k commands.
